# System Architecture

The APS system is built to streamline article production and tracking. It includes separate components for frontend, backend, and real-time updates.

## Key Points
- **Frontend**: 
    * **Framework**: React
    * **State Management**: Redux for managing complex states.
    * **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for flexible styling.
- **Backend**: 
    * **Framework**: Node.js with Express.
    * **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data.
    * **API Development**: GraphQL    
- **File Management**: 
    * **Storage:** Cloud storage options (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for handling large volumes of manuscript files.
    * **File Versioning:** Keep each file version accessible to ensure accurate tracking across stages.
- **Data Security**: 
    * **User Roles:** Authors, Editors, Proofreaders, Production Managers, and Admin.
    * **Permissions:** Restrict access to specific functions and data based on user roles.
- **Back-up & Retrieval**: 
    * **Periodic Backup**: Daily, weekly, and monthly backup.
    * **Retrieval**: 24 hours retrieval in case of any incident.

- **Authentication and Access Control**

    * **OAuth or JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication, providing secure login and role-based access control.  
    * **Identity Management Solutions**: For ease, consider using **Auth0** or **Firebase Authentication** to handle complex authentication flows, including multi-factor authentication if required.

- **Real-Time Features**

    * **WebSocket or Server-Sent Events** for real-time updates, like notifying users of task changes or article progress.  
    * **Frameworks**: **Socket.IO** (for Node.js) or **Django Channels** if using Django.

- **DevOps and Deployment**

    * **Containerization**: Use **Docker** to package and deploy APS as a set of microservices for scalability.  
    * **Orchestration**: **Kubernetes** for scaling and managing containers if expecting high traffic.  
    * **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Tools like **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, or **Jenkins** to automate testing and deployment.  
    * **Hosting**: **AWS**, **Google Cloud Platform**, or **Azure** to ensure scalability, with services like **Elastic Beanstalk** or **Kubernetes Engine** for seamless scaling.

- **Observability and Monitoring**

    * **Error Tracking**: Tools like **Sentry** or **LogRocket** to monitor and track application errors.  
    * **Application Monitoring**: **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring application performance and gathering insights on usage patterns.  
    * **Logging**: **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging and analysis, useful in debugging and optimizing performance.

- **Suggested Project Management Approach**

    * **Version Control**: Use **Git** with a remote repository like **GitHub** or **GitLab**.  
    * **Modular Development**: Break down the application into microservices or modular components to improve code reusability and maintenance.  
    * **Documentation**: Maintain documentation using tools like **Sphinx** for backend API documentation or **Storybook** for frontend components.

##Final Thoughts

This setup will ensure APS is highly configurable, scalable, and aligned with modern development standards.
