Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how the web application could be structured, along with some core features and design elements.

#Key Components & Stages of the System
1. **Article Submission Portal**: A user-friendly interface where authors or editors can upload manuscript files and related documents.  
    * **Features**: File upload, metadata input (author details, title, abstract), and automated validation for required fields.  
    * **Notifications**: Automated email confirmations upon successful submission.  
    * **Role-Based Access**: Different user roles such as authors, editors, reviewers, and production staff with varying levels of access.  
2. **Workflow Dashboard for Production Stages**: An interface for tracking each article through production.  
    * **Stage List**: Visual representation of each stage the article will pass through, such as:  
        * Initial Analysis (check completeness and usability)  
        * Pre-editing (formatting and preparation for the editorial process)  
        * Structural and XML Tagging  
        * Copyediting  
        * Typesetting and Formatting  
        * Proofing and Author Review  
    * **Status Updates**: Real-time updates on article status, stage progression, and completion.  
    * **Dependencies and Checks**: Logic to ensure certain stages can't proceed until specific tasks are completed.  
3. **Task Management & Assignment**: For each production stage, specific tasks can be assigned to team members.  
    * **Assignments**: Editors, proofreaders, and production staff can be assigned tasks with deadlines.  
    * **Automated Notifications**: Reminders and alerts for upcoming or overdue tasks.  
4. **Document & File Management**: For tracking different versions of documents through production.  
    * **Version Control**: Store, retrieve, and manage document versions as they progress through stages.  
    * **Centralized Repository**: Easy access for users to view the latest version or previous ones if needed.  
5. **Real-Time Tracking and Status Board**:  
    * **Tracking Overview**: A visual or tabular display that shows where each article is in the production pipeline.  
    * **Progress Indicators**: Show percentage completion, next steps, and overdue stages if applicable.  
6. **Collaborative Editing & Commenting**: Real-time commenting on tasks or files.  
    * **Integrated Notes**: Editors and staff can leave notes directly linked to files or specific tasks, which is useful for quick references.  
    * **Proof Distribution and Review**: Automatically distribute proofs to authors for review and feedback.  
7. **Metrics & Reporting**: To assess production times, bottlenecks, and productivity.  
    * **Reporting Tools**: Generate reports on production times, task durations, and completion rates for analysis and improvement.
